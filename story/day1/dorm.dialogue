After about 20 minutes walking, you finally reach the dorm.
Despite years of doing this almost every day, you can’t say you’ve gotten any more used to it.
It feels like this city has 2 suns, and one is already too much for you.

Mitch: Hah.. hah… [#tired]

You slowly wobble over to the door, trying your best to control your breathing as you do.

???: Woah, the weather got you huh, miss?

You look over your shoulder to see a friendly looking woman wearing a security outfit.
She looks to be in her 40s and she's a fair bit shorter than you.

Dorm Security Guard: You’re not looking too good there…
Mitch: Thank you for your concern, ma’am. The weather’s a bit rough but I’ll be fine in no time.
Dorm Security Guard: Well, if you say so, miss.
Dorm Security Guard: If I may recommend, the pantry’s a pretty good place to cool down if you haven’t turned on the AC in your room yet.
Dorm Security Guard: The water dispenser’s up and running again and the ice has been restocked.
Dorm Security Guard: The fan has been on since this morning too so it should be proper breezy by now.
Mitch: Oh, thank you for the recommendation ma’am. I’ll check it out!

The security guard smiles and nods to you before heading back towards her post.

You haven’t been to the pantry in a while, you guess it won’t hurt to give it a look…

After passing by your room to turn on the AC, you make your way towards the dormitory pantry.

set State.day = "Day 1"
set State.location = "Pantry, Dormitory"
do change_icon("res://assets/sprites/sun.png")
do bg_show_path("res://assets/bgs/dorm_pantry.png")

Mitch: Woah… the security guard wasn’t kidding…

As you enter the pantry, you feel the breeze of the ceiling fan hit you immediately, cooling you off.
Not only that, but it seems that it’s gotten a pretty big upgrade since you’ve last been here.
They changed the fridge here to a bigger one, the cookware looks newer, and they changed the gas stove to an electric one.

Mitch: The tables are close to the sockets too…

You could definitely work on your homework here as you wait for your room to cool down.
There’s no one else around too, the perfect studying environment for you.

Well, no one else but…

do sfx_start()
???: Meow!

Mitch: Tuxy? Come here buddy! [#smile]

You hear a bit of rustling as your familiar friend makes his way from behind the water dispenser to approach you.

Tuxy: Meow!

Tuxy is the dorm cat. Unofficially, that is.
It’s common knowledge that the dorms here aren’t supposed to allow pets, but Tuxy is so beloved amongst dorm staff and residents that he’s become an exception to that rule.

- Pet him
	You pet your little buddy on his head, letting him purr to his heart’s content.
	do State.cat_friendliness += 20

	Mitch: Heheh, good boy.

- Offer him food
	You assume he might be hungry and open the cabinet reserved just for him to get his food out.
	Mitch: You want this, buddy?
	You pour a bit of the food into his bowl in the corner.

	Tuxy: Mreow.
	Tuxy: Meow!

	Tuxy walks to the table instead, ignoring the bowl of food.
	Well, at least you tried.

With Tuxy in tow, you open your laptop and set it down on a table near one of the sockets.
As you begin working on the task that Professor Idyllin assigned, you feel Tuxy claim his spot beside you and curl up to sleep.
Tuxy’s been around since the first semester you’ve been here and he’s often kept you company just like this, though usually when you’re working in your room.
You think he’s your most loyal friend.
You don't know how to feel about that.

do bg_hide()
do wait(1.0)
do bg_show()

Mitch: Agh… finally done…

You stretch your body and yawn.
After 3 hours, you’re finally done with Professor Idyllin’s task.
You get up to tidy your things from the table. Tuxy’s already wandered off on his own at this point.

Mitch: Guess it’s time to hit the hay.

Finally, home sweet home.

These four walls have been your home for the past few years of going here, and it’s served you well.

You set your bag down at the foot of your bed and set your newly acquired medicine on the nightstand.

Mitch: …

do music_stop()

You haven't mentioned this to anyone, but hunger and nightmares aren't the only things keeping you up at night.

Mitch: … [#sad]

It gets awfully lonely here.
You used to have a lot of friends over, but as the semesters went on, your schedule and theirs began to differ and clash.
A lot of them stopped rooming at the dorm as well, preferring to commute from home every day since they live quite near.
Your house is a train ride away. You can’t afford that luxury.

Mitch: … [#sad]

When you got sick last year, the sickness itself wasn’t even as bad as the feeling of isolation that came with it.

if State.go_with_michelle == true:
	Thankfully, things are a little different this time around.
	do music_start()
	You open your phone, quickly typing something to send to someone.

	[b]mitchee[/b]\nGot the meds! I’ll be taking them and turning in early tonight (- v -)

	do sfx_start_path("res://assets/sounds/chat_message.wav")
	You get a reply a few seconds later.

	[b]Michelle W.[/b]\nGlad to hear! Sleep well, hope they’ll help uu.

	if State.michelle_affection >= 30:
		You smile to yourself.

		You were just about to set your phone down on the nightstand before the notification sound rings again.
		do sfx_start()
		
		[b]Michelle W.[/b]\nG’nite ^o^.

		You laugh a little. You’re glad that you somehow still have her as your friend.
	else:
		You smile as you set your phone down on the nightstand.

You turn to the medicine and grab your water bottle from your bag.
You hope that this will truly prevent last year’s situation from repeating again.

Mitch: Uh… [#sleepy]
	
do music_stop()

The potency of the medicine takes you off-guard.
You remember Dr. Sammy telling you that it’ll take effect quite quickly, but you didn’t think it’d be this quick.

Mitch: Ah… huh…. H…. [#sleepy]

You feel extremely sleepy.
You sway and trip on the foot of the bed, crashing down onto the mattress.

Mitch: ……… [#sleepy]
